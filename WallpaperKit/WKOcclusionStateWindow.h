Singleton of the Window which persists across all WorkSpaces
OStateChangeNotificationName is posted when OcclusionState Changes.
Notification UserInfo Contains:
    - @"Visibility" and @"CurrentSpaceID" wrapped in NSNumber
 
 @discussion [NSScreen mainScreen].visibleFrame returns the frame without menubar/dock and stuff.
            However that means our window must be fully covered pixel by pixel to trigger an OSChange,
            which is unlikely to happen in real-life scenario. (Remember a Cocoa Window usually has circle bounds instead of rects,thus it will always left out a few pixels.
            Thus we craft a frame slightly smaller than this frame to suit real-life usage better.
